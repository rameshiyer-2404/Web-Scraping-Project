# Real Estate Web Scraping and Automation Project

This project is a python script that scrapes data from a real estate website, extracting details such as property prices, addresses, and descriptions. The data was scraped using Beautiful Soup and the process of submitting the scraped data was automated using Selenium into a MS Form which was later consolidated into an Excel file for easy analysis.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
